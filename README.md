# Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player connection rack game, in which the players choose a color and then take <br>
turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall <br>
straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be <br>
the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
